ACTOR SEARCH

In this application I've created a GIF generator using the Giphy API.

The page is preloaded with five buttons that will generate gifs of the actors pre-rendered upon click.

Also available is the ability to add an actor via the form, and generate gifs for them upon button click.

There is a limit of 10 Gifs that will load, and at first they will appear as static images. Upon click of the Gif it will play, and can also be stopped upon click.

I used some of the activities we did in class, as well as Stack Overflow as guides to complete this HW assignment. 

I used Bootstrap for the most part in my styling of the page. I had some trouble styling my buttons to look differently after my logic was functioning. So for my next project I will build the front end first, and then start working on my logic.

As a bonus I made this application mobile responsive.

I also learned that AJAX calls do not work if you have the slim build of jQuery linked to your html file.
